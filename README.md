# Off-The-Couch

Build an application that can take a variety of user inputs such as location, interest and generate an output of activities or things to do nearby or based on selected location.

As a user with free time but not sure what to do. I would like to have a choice of activities based on my interests or randomly generated/suggested. So that I don’t have to spend the time thinking of things to do.

As a user with little free time, I want to have some activities randomly generated for me to chose from so I have something to do.
•	I want to have the result also stored for future reference
